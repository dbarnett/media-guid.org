    <p>This is a community site intended to create a simple, community-driven
standard for uniquely identifying multimedia content and media-related
entities.</p>
    <p>Anyone can create an ID attached to a unique creative work (e.g., movie, TV show/series, written publication, painting), or any media-related entity (e.g., author, musical group, publisher), and link it to any associated ISBN/ASIN, website, etc.</p>
    <p>It was developed by David Barnett.</p>
